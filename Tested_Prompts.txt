Tested Prompts
 
Prompt1 with GPT5mini
 
Generate and execute a Playwright test using pytest and Playwright MCP.

Test Scenario:
 
Open http://www.automationpractice.pl/index.php
 
Search for "T-shirts"
 
Verify that "Faded Short Sleeve T-shirts" is displayed in the search results

Implementation Requirements:

Use pytest-style structure (functions starting with test_).

Execute each step interactively through Playwright MCP tools.

Once all steps succeed, generate and save the final test script as PlaywrightPythonMcp/search_product.py.

Run the saved test automatically in headed mode (browser visible) and open the report.

If any step or assertion fails, identify and fix the issue, then rerun until the test passes.

Expected Output:

A fully working Playwright + pytest test script.

The script should automate the complete flow described above and successfully validate the product name in the results.

 
Prompt2 with GPT5
 
You are a Playwright Test Generator, an expert in browser automation and end-to-end testing.

Your specialty is creating robust, reliable Playwright tests that accurately simulate user interactions and validate

application behavior.
 
 
Generate Playwright python tests for all manual test cases in:

- File: PlaywrightPythonMcp/manualtests/manualtestcases.md

- Test data: PlaywrightPythonMcp/config/env.py

Requirements for each test you generate:

1. Each test case must become a pytest function: test_<TC_ID>.

2. Map all `Test Data` entries to env.py values (e.g., SKUs, usernames, passwords).

3. Use Playwright MCP to open the browser and interact with the site.

4. Discover selectors and flows by live exploration through playwright mcp, not by static code generation.

5. Save scripts as PlaywrightPythonMcp/tests/<TC_ID>.py

6. Run tests in headed mode (browser visible).

7. If a step or assertion fails, identify, fix, and rerun until passing.

8. Generate a final report after all test cases.

9. DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone.

10. DO NOT use Pylance.

11. DO NOT install Pytest or Python as they are already installed.
 
Prompt3 with GPT5 with pageobjects
 
You are a Playwright Test Generator, an expert in browser automation and end-to-end testing.

Your specialty is creating robust, reliable Playwright tests that accurately simulate user interactions and validate

application behavior.
 
 
Generate Playwright python tests for all manual test cases in:

- File: PlaywrightPythonMcp/manualtests/manualtestcases.md

- Test data: PlaywrightPythonMcp/config/env.py

Requirements for each test you generate:

1. Each test case must become a pytest function: test_<TC_ID>.

2. Map all `Test Data` entries to env.py values (e.g., SKUs, usernames, passwords).

3. Use Playwright MCP to open the browser and interact with the site.

4. Discover selectors and flows by live exploration through playwright mcp, not by static code generation.

5. Make sure to use Playwright's best practices and page object model.

6. Store all element locators inside separate Page Object Model classes in "PlaywrightPythonMcp/page_objects/"

7. Tests must use these POM classes and must not contain hardcoded selectors.

8. Save scripts as PlaywrightPythonMcp/tests/<TC_ID>.py

9. Run tests in headed mode (browser visible).

10. If a step or assertion fails, identify, fix, and rerun until passing.

11. Generate a final report after all test cases are executed successfully and open the report.

12. DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone.

13. DO NOT use Pylance.

14. DO NOT install Pytest or Python as they are already installed.
